**ROptim (Random Optimizer): Guessing its way to optimization glory with multithreaded chaos and a sprinkle of luck.**  

## What is ROptim?  
ROptim is an experimental multithreaded optimizer that uses a stochastic refinement process (read: a lot of clever guessing) to narrow the gap between an initial random guess and a target value. Built with Python and a healthy dose of chaos, it leverages threading to speed up the guessing game.  

## Features  
- Multithreaded optimization for faster convergence.  
- Stochastic approach to problem-solving.  
- A unique, random narrowing range that guarantees results (eventually).  
- Built to tackle absurdly large numbers, because why not?  

## How it works  
1. Start with a random guess somewhere between 0 and the target value.  
2. Use multiple threads to refine the guess range, narrowing it closer to the target with every iteration.  
3. Repeat until the guess is close enough to the target (within 0.01, because we’re perfectionists).  

## Example Usage  
```python
import threading
import random

target = 48
guess = random.uniform(0.0, float(target))
lr = 0.01
lock = threading.Lock()

# Optimization logic here (see the code in the repo).
```

## Why ROptim?  
Because sometimes, brute force gets the job done. ROptim combines random guesses, threading magic, and a bit of luck to create a quirky but effective approach to optimization.
